-Representation Class
    Created class with same properties as the output JSON object.
    It is immutable

    EmployeeDAO is an interface which contains methods corresponding to single sql queries

-BasicAuth
    Used builtin BasicCredential to get client's User and Password instead of custom credential
    Created CRM_Authenticator to validate user cred with the given cred, Initialized UserDao instance to get cred from database
    Created a custom principal(UserPrincipal) to get the result from authenticator.
    Didn't use authorizer for roles(maybe in future work?)

    Added Resources Environment to incorporate resource class

    Created DBI instance and added it to Resources env to incorporate data transfer from database using JDBI

    Created Auth env
